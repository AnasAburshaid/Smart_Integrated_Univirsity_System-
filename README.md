# Smart Integrated University Portal System 🎓

## Overview
This is a **comprehensive University Portal System** designed to manage academic and administrative services within a university environment.  
The system provides **three separate UIs** for **Students, Teachers, and Administrators**, each tailored to the user’s role.  
The backend is built in **C++** using the **Drogon API Framework**, with a **SQLite** database, and the frontend is built using **React.js, TypeScript, and Vite**.  

This project was developed as part of the **Bachelor in Software Engineering** at Al-Balqa Applied University, supervised by **Dr. Khalid Alkharabsheh**.
